\parttitle{Objective} %if any
The purpose of this double-blind, randomised, controlled trial is to compare allergic outcomes in children following vaccination with acellular pertussis (aP) antigen (standard of care in Australia) given at 2 months of age versus whole cell pertussis (wP) in the infant vaccine schedule.

\parttitle{Participants} %if any
Up to 3,000 Australian infants 6 to \textless 12 weeks of age born $\geq$ 32 weeks gestation.

\parttitle{Interventions} %if any
The intervention is a wP containing vaccine as the first scheduled pertussis vaccine dose instead of an aP containing vaccine.

\parttitle{Outcomes} %if any
The primary outcome is a binary indicator of IgE-mediated food allergy at the age of 12 months confirmed, where necessary, with an oral food challenge before 18 months of age. Secondary outcomes include: (1) parent-reported clinician-diagnosed new onset of atopic dermatitis by 6 or 12 months of age with a positive skin prick test to any allergen by 12 months of age; (2) a fourfold or greater rise in pertussis toxin-specific IgG before and 21 to 35 days after a booster dose of aP at 18 months of age; (3) sensitisation to at least one allergen by 12 months of age.

\parttitle{Discussion} %if any
A detailed, prospective statistical analysis plan (SAP) is presented for this Bayesian adaptive design. 
The plan was written by the trial statistician and details the study design, pre-specified adaptive elements, decision thresholds, statistical methods and the simulations used to evaluate the operating characteristics of the trial. 
Application of this SAP will minimise bias and supports transparent and reproducible research.

\section*{Introduction}

Combination vaccines containing whole-cell pertussis (wP) antigens were phased out from the Australian national immunisation program between 1997 and 1999 and replaced by the less reactogenic acellular pertussis (aP) antigens.
In a large case-control study of Australian children born during the transition period, those with allergist diagnosed IgE-mediated food allergy were less likely to have received whole-cell vaccine in early infancy than matched population controls [odds ratio: 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (0.62, 0.95)] \cite{estcourt2020whole}.
We hypothesise that a single dose of whole-cell vaccine in early infancy is protective against IgE-mediated food allergy in early childhood.

This statistical analysis plan (SAP) provides \textit{a priori} specification of the decision-making rules and the statistical methods to be used. 
The SAP was prepared after data collection had commenced, but prior to observing any of the data. 
The coordinating principal investigator was responsible for approving the SAP, and it was reviewed and approved by the trial independent data monitoring safety board (DMSB). 
The SAP is written to be consistent with the CONSORT 2010 Statement and further guidelines and supports transparent and reproducible research.

\section*{Study Synopsis}

The OPTIMUM trial is a phase IV, prospective, multi-centre, two-armed, double-blinded, randomised, superiority, adaptive clinical trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a first scheduled dose of wP vaccine in preventing food allergy, compared to the standard aP vaccine in healthy, vaccine-eligible infants aged 6 to \textless12 weeks born at \(\geq\) 32 weeks gestation in Australia.

The trial uses a Bayesian group-sequential design with pre-specified stopping rules informed by predictive probabilities of trial outcomes given the data available at interim analyses.

The protocol defines two stages of the trial.
During stage 1....
During stage 2....

\section*{Interventions}

Eligible participants will be randomised to receive a 0.5 ml dose of the WHO-prequalified pentavalent formulation of diptheria-tetanus-pertussis (whole-cell)-Hepatitis-B- \textit{Haemophilus influenzae} type b vaccine (DTwP-HB-Hib) (PENTABIO\textregistered PT, Bio Frama, study vaccine), or else a hexavalent formulation of DTaP-HB-Hib plus inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (INFANRIX HEXA\textregistered, GlaxoSmithKline, comparator vaccine), as the first dose of the pertussis vaccination schedule between 6 to \textless 12 weeks of age.
This is given via intramuscular injection into the anterolateral aspect of the right thigh.
Other scheduled 6-week doses are co-administered per Australia's national immunisation program.

\section*{Study Population}

Stage 1 of the study is being conducted at sites in Perth, Western Australia.
Recruitment started in January 2018, with the 150th participant randomised in January 2020.
Stage 2 will also include sites in Sydney and Melbourne.

\subsection*{Inclusion Criteria}

An eligible infant must fulfil all the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Healthy male or female infant aged 6 to \textless12 weeks old.
	\item Born $\geq$ 32 weeks gestation.
	\item
	Parent or Legally Accepted Representative (LAR) who has the capacity to understand the parent information sheet and consent form (PISCF) and study related procedures.
	\item Parent or LAR is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial.
	\item Infant known to be free of significant medical problems as determined by a medical history and clinical examination by a medically qualified investigator.
	\item Parent or LAR has access to a telephone.
	\item Parent or LAR who is able and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol in the opinion of an investigator.
	\item Parent or LAR is willing to allow other parties involved in the treatment of their child (including general practitioner, medical centre staff and any other medical professionals the child may be a patient of for the duration of the trial) to be notified of their participation in the trial and for participation in the trial to be recorded within the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). The parent/LAR is willing to allow the study team to obtain a vaccination history from AIR and/or local provider.
	\item Parent or LAR is willing to allow the study team to obtain information from the infants doctor, other health care professionals, hospitals or laboratories concerning the infants health from enrolment until 1 month after the 18-month vaccinations.
	\item Infant available for the entire study period.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Exclusion Criteria}

The participant may not enter the trial if any of the following apply:

\begin{itemize}
	\item History of pre-existing parent-reported clinician diagnosed IgE-mediated food allergy.
	\item History of parent-reported, clinician-diagnosed pertussis infection.
	\item Receipt of any prior vaccine, except for a single birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine within the first 7 days of life (only for visit 1).
	\item Contraindication to any routine infant immunisation: History of allergy, including anaphylaxis, to any vaccine or vaccine component.
	\item Contraindication to paracetamol.
	\item Receipt of investigational vaccines/drugs, other than the vaccines used in the study, since birth or their planned use during the study period, until the final study visit (i.e.~at approximately 19 months of age).
	\item Receipt, or planned receipt, of any non-routine vaccines within 14 days after the first dose of pertussis containing vaccine.
	\item Receipt of more than 2 weeks of immunosuppressants or immune modifying drugs (e.g.~prednisolone \textgreater0.5mg/kg/day).
	\item Serious chronic illness including severe congenital anomalies affecting heart, brain and/or lungs.
	\item History of any neurologic disorders or seizures.
	\item Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.
	\item Planned travel to any region that remains at risk of a poliomyelitis transmission at any time before study visit 8 for stage 1, and for stage 2, before the final phone/electronic contact at approximately 19 months of age.
	\item Parents or LAR who plan to move out of the geographical area where the study would be conducted.
	\item Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the trial.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Temporary Exclusion Criteria For Vaccination}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Fever ($\geq$38 $^{\circ}$C as determined by axillary assessment) and/or acute disease at the time of recruitment or at any study visit where vaccination will occur as defined by the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever (with the exception of minor illnesses such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection without fever). In such situations randomisation or the study visit should be postponed until the participant has recovered.
	\item For stage 1 (visit 2, 3 and 7 only), receipt of any vaccination with a licensed vaccine product, including seasonal influenza vaccination or meningococcal vaccination, within the preceding 14 days. In these situations, the study visit should be deferred until 14 days have elapsed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Elimination Criteria During The Study}

The following criteria will be checked at each visit subsequent to the first visit.
If any become applicable during the study, it will not require automatic withdrawal of the participants from the study, but may determine the participant's evaluability in the per-protocol (PP) analysis.
The data would, however, continue to be included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use, or planned use, of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) during the study period, until 1 month after the final study visit (i.e.~at approximately 20 months of age).
	\item For Stage 1 only: Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during the study period (for corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone $\geq$ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed).
	\item For Stage 1 only:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 14 days after any scheduled vaccine dose.
		\item Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the study period.
		\item Administration of any of the vaccines used in the study outside of the stipulated period.
		\item Administration of any live vaccines, those containing tetanus or diphtheria related antigens or those that contain bacterial lipo-polysaccharide or other adjuvanted vaccines between study visit 3 and study visit 5.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Objectives and Outcomes}

\subsection*{Primary}

The primary objective is to determine whether, compared to three priming doses of aP, a mixed wP/aP schedule (first dose of wP followed by doses of aP) protects against the development of IgE-mediated food allergy.

The primary outcome is IgE-mediated food allergy at the age of 12 months and confirmed, where necessary by oral food challenge (OFC), before 18 months.
A participant will be considered to have the outcome if there is evidence of sensitisation to a food on skin prick test (SPT), and either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item unequivocal IgE-mediated food allergy, defined as (i) a positive oral food challenge, or (ii) clinician-diagnosed food anaphylaxis, with symptoms affecting at least 2 of the following: skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular system,
	\item highly probable IgE-mediated food allergy, defined as history of food allergic reaction consistent with PRACTALL criteria \cite{sampson2012standardizing}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Secondary}

\subsubsection*{Clinical and mechanistic outcomes}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compare the rate of new onset atopic dermatitis in each study group. 
	Two binary outcomes will be investigated:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A history of parent-reported clinician-diagnosed new onset atopic dermatitis by 6 months of age and a positive SPT to any allergen by approximately 12 months of age.
		\item A history of parent-reported clinician-diagnosed new onset atopic dermatitis by 12 months of age and a positive SPT to any allergen by approximately 12 months of age
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Compare the rate of SPT positivity to common allergens in each study group.
	Two binary outcomes will be investigated:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A SPT wheals $>$1mm greater than the negative control to at least one allergen by approximately 12 months of age.
		\item A SPT wheals $\geq$3mm greater than the negative control to at least one allergen by approximately 12 months of age.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Stage 1 atopic immunophenotypic response}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Compare the Th2 immunophenotypic response to tetanus toxoid and egg antigens in infants in each study group.
	IgE concentrations to the following antigens will be collected at ages 6, 7 and 19 months using ImmunoCAP total and specific IgE assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific/Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) during stage 1 only (150 participants):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Total IgE concentration
		\item IgE concentration to tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine antigen
		\item IgE concentration to egg white antigen
		\item IgE concentration to whole egg antigen
	\end{enumerate}
	Assays will be in KU IgE/L per sample.
	IgE levels $\geq$ 0.35 KU/L are considered positive.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Stage 1 and 2 vaccine response}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Compare vaccine antibody responses.
	Vaccine antigen-specific IgG titres will be measured at ages 6, 7, 18 (pre-booster), and 19 (post-booster) months using a multiplex fleuoresenct bead assay \cite{van2008development}, for the following during stage 1 (and limited participants in stage 2 at 18 and 19 months of age for pertussis toxin only).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Pertussis toxin (PT) (stage 1 and 2)
		\item Filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA)
		\item Pertactin (PRN)
		\item Tetanus toxoid (TT)
		\item Polyribosylribitol phosphate (HiB-PRP)
		\item 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine serotypes
	\end{enumerate}
	The putative protective and seroprotective thresholds are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\geq 5$ IU/mL for PT, FHA, and PRN
		\item $\geq 0.1$ IU/mL  for TT \cite{whotetanus}
		\item $\geq 1$ $\mu$g/mL for HiB-PRP \cite{kayhty1983protective}
		\item $\geq 0.35$ $\mu$g/mL for pneumococcal serotypes \cite{siber2007estimating,whopneumo}
	\end{itemize}
	A 4-fold or greater increase from pre-booster (18 months) to post-booster (19 months) is considered evidence of Th-memory induced boosting (REFERENCE?).
\end{enumerate}

Additional details of outcome definitions and assays are available in the protocol.

\section*{Randomisation}

Eligible participants will be randomised in 1:1 allocation to receive the study or comparator vaccine.
Randomisation is by computer-generated allocation sequence prepared by the trial statistician [JT] and based on randomly permuted blocks of size 6, 8 or 10.
The randomisation codes are password-protected and held by the trial statistician.

\section*{Blinding}

The allocation sequence is concealed from all blinded research staff in a non-transparent envelope until completion of the study.
An unblinded pharmacist or research nurse obtains the next contiguous allocation and prepares the study or comparator vaccine into a clear 1 ml ready administer syringe, labelled with the study participant's number and their identifiers.
The syringes are covered to prevent unblinding.
At enrolment, vaccines may be administered by either a blinded, or an unblinded nurse.
If unblinded, this nurse has no further involvement in the follow-up of the participant.
Parents and all other research staff remain blinded until study completion.

To maintain blinding while ensuring all participants receive at least three priming doses of IPV, a dose of DTaP-IPV (INFANRIX\textregistered IPV, GlaxoSmithKline, catch-up vaccine), in lieu of DTaP, is administered to all participants at age 18 months.

The blinding process may be broken under compelling medical or safety circumstances. 
Code breaks will be authorised by the coordinating principal investigator and will be communicated directly to the parents and/or medical team by the trial statistician.

\section*{Sample Size}

A maximum sample size of 3,000 participants is planned; 150 participants in stage 1 and up to 2,850 in stage 2.
In accordance with trial simulations of the above design, we estimated the trial would have 85\% power to detect a reduction in IgE-mediated food allergy by 12 months of age from 10\% to 7\% while controlling the probability of a type I error at 5\%.

The sample size for this study is adaptive, therefore the actual trial sample size may be less than 3,000 participants. Based on simulations undertaken for the trial design, the actual sample size is likely to be at least 1,000 participants given the expected accrual rates and timing of the first interim analysis.
We estimated a 69\% probability of stopping early for futility if the null were true, and in the alternative scenario (reduction from 10\% to 7\% in the primary outcome), we estimated 59\% probability of stopping early for expected success.

\section*{Statistical Analysis}

\subsection*{Baseline characteristics}

All subjects who were invited to participate in this trial will be accounted for, and a CONSORT flow chart will be prepared.
Reasons for early withdrawal will be listed for all participants that prematurely withdrew from the study.
The number of participants that were screened but not randomised will be presented and the reasons for their non-participation will be listed (where available).
Numbers of participants who were randomised, fulfilled eligibility criteria, and number randomised by study centre, will be summarised.

The trial participants will be summarised according to baseline variables.
The data for each baseline variable will be presented descriptively.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\begin{table}[!ht]
	\caption{Pre-defined analysis sets to be used in summaries and analyses.}
	\label{tab:analysis-sets}
	\begin{tabular}{lp{8cm}}
		Population & Description \\ \hline

\end{table}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}

\subsection*{Analysis of Primary Outcome}

Descriptive counts and proportions of the primary outcome will be tabulated by treatment group, including the number of inconclusive results.

Inferences for the primary outcome will be based on Bayesian models. Interest lies in the measure of effect of the study vaccine on the primary endpoint relative to the comparator vaccine, denoted by \(\delta\).
Depending on the model, this might represent the difference in proportions meeting the primary outcome, or some transformation of these proportions (log odds-ratio).
In either case, the primary statistical hypotheses are:
$$
\textrm{H}_0:\delta\geq 0\ \text{vs. } \mathrm{H}_1:\delta <0
$$

At the final analysis, evidence of effect will be measured as the posterior probability that $\delta < 0$ (that is, the study vaccine reduces IgE-mediated food allergy), conditional on the specified model given the data observed.
If this posterior probability meets a pre-specified threshold of evidence, \(q\), then a decision of superiority is recommended at the final analysis (trial success).
The decision rule is (conditional on data $D$):
$$
d(D) = \begin{cases}
\text{success} & \text{if } \mathbb{P}(\delta<0|D)>q \\
\text{failure}\ & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

For this study, the threshold for assessing superiority was $q=0.95$.
This value was chosen based on simulation studies investigating the effect of the interim analysis stopping rules on the probability of false positives, false negatives, and expected sample size.

Although superiority is recommended by the formal test of the above hypotheses, effect sizes will be presented as a summary (mean, median, and 95\% credible interval) of the posterior density obtained at the final analysis in addition to the posterior probability of superiority.

The primary analysis of the outcome will use independent Beta-Binomial models for the response proportion in the two study arms.
In this case, $\delta=\theta_w-\theta_a$, the difference in probability of IgE-mediated food allergy between the two vaccine schedules.
In this analysis, data will be pooled across sites.
$\text{Beta}(1,1)$ priors will be assumed for both response probabilities.

\subsection*{Adjusted Analysis}

A secondary supportive analysis of the primary outcome will use logistic regression to estimate a covariate adjusted odds ratio associated with the study vaccine.
In this model the effect, $\delta$ relates to the relative log-odds of the primary outcome associated with the study vaccine, conditional on the included covariates.
The prognostic baseline covariates to be included are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item gender
	\item study site
	\item ANY OTHER PROGNOSTIC FACTORS WORTH ADJUSTING FOR?
\end{itemize}

We will specify weakly informative Student t priors for regression coefficients with 4 degrees of freedom, 0 mean, and standard deviation of 1.75.

Inference will be based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples.

\subsection*{Analysis of Secondary Outcomes}

\subsubsection*{Clinical and Mechanistic}

Based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis sets, the proportion of participants with each clinical and mechanistic outcome response will be reported.
Unadjusted 95\% CI for the difference in proportions between the study vaccine and comparator will be calculated using the Newcombe Hybrid Score (NHS) interval \cite{newcombe1998interval}.
Any adjusted analyses will use logistic regression models where the mean and 95\% confidence intervals on the odds ratio associated with receiving the study vaccine will be reported along with any other model parameters.
These models will adjust for the same covariates as in the adjusted model for the primary outcome.

Based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis sets, the proportion of participants with each clinical and mechanistic outcome response will be reported.
Unadjusted posterior summaries for the difference in proportions between the study vaccine and comparator will be calculated using Beta-Binomial models as for the primary outcome.
Adjusted analyses will use logistic regression models where posterior summaries of the adjusted odds ratio associated with receiving the study vaccine will be reported along with any other model parameters.
These models will adjust for the same covariates as in the adjusted model for the primary outcome and use the same priors.

\subsubsection*{Laboratory - stage 1 atopic immunophenotypic response}

The sensitivity of the assay for total IgE concentrations is between 2 kU/L and 5,000 kU/L.
Antigen specific IgE will be reported in concentrations with ranges from 0.00 to 100.00 kU/L.
Results outside these limits will be reported as above or below the detection limit.

For analyses of concentrations, concentration measurements will be $\text{log}_{10}$ transformed and concentrations outside the detection limits will be treated as censored in analyses.

For each outcome, we will report by treatment group and visit for the stage 1 and stage 1+2 assay analysis sets:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the median and range of concentrations
	\item the proportion of missing concentrations
	\item the proportion of concentrations outside detection limits
	\item the proportion of concentrations exceeding the positive response threshold
	\item Kaplan-Meier plots of concentrations
\end{itemize}

Inferences for geometric mean concentrations (GMC) will assume censored multivariate normal models for log-concentrations by visit with unstructured covariance matrices and visit by treatment specific means.
If issues arise with the covariance structure, a simpler covariance model will be assumed, such as heterogenous compound symmetry.
Weakly informative normal(0, 1) priors will be specified for means and LKJ prior on the Cholesky factor of the correlation matrix and Cauchy(0, 2.5) on the standard deviations.

Inferences for relative proportions exceeding positive response threshold by study group will assume logistic regression models with a fixed term for treatment group.

\subsubsection*{Laboratory - stage 1 and 2 vaccine response}

IgG concentrations (ANY DETAILS ON THE ASSAY?)

For analyses of concentrations, concentration measurements will be $\text{log}_{10}$ transformed and concentrations outside the detection limits will be treated as censored in analyses.

For each outcome, we will report by treatment group and visit for the stage 1 and stage 1+2 assay analysis sets:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the median and range of concentrations
	\item the proportion of missing concentrations
	\item the proportion of concentrations outside detection limits
	\item the proportion of concentrations exceeding the positive response threshold
	\item the proportion of participants with a 4-fold or greater increase or a change from below the limit of detection to above in their concentration from 18 to 19 months 
	\item Kaplan-Meier plots of concentrations
\end{itemize}

Inferences for relative GMC and proportions will be as for the atopic immunophenotypic response outcomes.

Non-inferiority of the mixed aP/wP immunisation regime compared to the NIP with respect to PT will be assessed relative to a non-inferiority margin of 2/3 on the GMC ratio.
If the GMC ratio for a particular antigen and visit is defined as
$$
\text{GMR} = \frac{\text{GMC}_\text{wP}}{\text{GMC}_\text{aP}}
$$ 
then non-inferiority will be evaluated according to
$$
\mathbb P\left[\text{GMR}\geq \frac{2}{3}\Big\vert \text{data}\right].
$$

(ANY REFERENCE FOR NON-INFERIORITY MARGIN OF 2/3?)

\subsection*{Subgroup Analyses}

No pre-specified subgroup analyses will be undertaken; however, some subgroup effects may be investigated as part of post-hoc analyses.
Any such subgroup analyses will be noted as being post-hoc.

\subsection*{Interim Analyses}

This trial includes interim analyses to be undertaken at pre-specified sample sizes to recommend whether the trial should be stopped early for futility or expected success.

The recommendations are made in accordance with pre-specified stopping rules based on the data available at the time of the interim.
The decisions on whether to stop are informed by Bayesian predictive probabilities of treatment effect.

Interim analyses begin after 200 subjects have complete primary outcome data.
Subsequent interim analyses will occur every additional 200 subjects with complete primary outcome data until either a stopping rule is met, or enrolment is close to completion.
Once a decision to stop has been made, or enrolment has reached the maximum sample size, enrolment will cease and all participants will be followed to study completion.

The process for interim decisions is as follows.
Let $\mathbb P(\delta < 0|D_k)$ denote the posterior probability of superiority under the specified model given data up to interim $k=1,2,...,K$ where complete data from $n_k$ participants are available.
We specify a prediction model, $f(\tilde D_k|D_k)$ for future outcome data $\tilde D_k$ that uses the data observed so far, marginalised over any uncertainty in the prediction model parameters.
Using predictions of the primary outcome for subjects enrolled who are yet to complete follow-up, and subjects yet to be enrolled, the stopping decision is based on the predicted outcome of the trial (in terms of the decision rule used at the final analysis) if it were stopped now (with follow-up completed on enrolled participants), or continued to the maximum sample size, given what has been observed up to interim $k$.

The predicted probability of success (PPoS) is calculated as
$$
\text{PPoS}_k(q) = \mathbb E_{\tilde D_k | D_k}\left[\textbf{1}_{(q,1]}\left\{\mathbb P(\delta<0|D_k,\tilde D_k)\right\}\right]
$$
and is the probability that superiority would be decided at a final analysis using threshold $q$ and future data $\tilde D_k$ according to $f(\tilde D_k|D_k)$.

The value of \(\text{PPoS}_k\) depends on the specified prediction model.
In this trial, the posterior predictive distribution of the primary analysis model is used as the prediction model.
This is two independent beta-binomial distributions conditional on the observed responses in each treatment group.

\subsubsection*{Stopping Rules}

Two stopping rules are specified: expected success and futility.
At each planned interim analysis $k=1,2,...,K$, let $n_i^k$ denote the number of participants in arm $i$ who have reached the primary endpoint by the time of interim $k$.
Let $y_i^k$ denote the number of participants in arm $i$ out of $n_i^k$ who had a response and $D_k$ denote all the available data.
In addition to the participants with observed outcomes at interim $k$, there are $m_i^k$ participants enrolled in arm $i$, of which some unknown $\tilde w_i^k$ will have a future response. There are also $l_i^k$ participants who could still be enrolled into arm $i$ (in 1:1 allocation up to maximum sample size) of which some unknown $\tilde z_i^k$ will have a future response.

Using the prediction model and primary analysis model, the following values are calculated
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{PPoS}_k^0(q) &= \mathbb E_{\tilde w_1^k,\tilde w_2^k|y_1^k,y_2^k}\left[\textbf{1}_{(q,1]}\left\{\mathbb P\left(\delta<0|y_1^k,y_2^k,\tilde w_1^k,\tilde w_2^k\right)\right\}\right] \\
\text{PPoS}_k^1(q) &= \mathbb E_{\tilde w_1^k,\tilde w_2^k,\tilde z_1^k,\tilde z_2^k|y_1^k,y_2^k}\left[\textbf{1}_{(q,1]}\left\{\mathbb P\left(\delta<0|y_1^k,y_2^k,\tilde w_1^k,\tilde w_2^k,\tilde z_1^k,\tilde z_2^k\right)\right\}\right].
\end{aligned}
$$

The decision rule used for recommendations at interim analyses (assuming at least some number of participants are still to be enrolled to achieve the maximum sample size) is
$$
d(D_k)=\begin{cases}
\text{stop for expected success} & \text{if } \text{PPoS}_k^0(q) > \overline{c}_k \\
\text{stop for futility} & \text{if } \text{PPoS}_k^1(q) < \underline{c}_k \\
\text{continue to analysis }k+1 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $q=0.95$, $\overline{c}_k=0.95$, and $\underline{c}_k=0.05$ as selected by simulation.

\subsection*{Missing Data}

Reasons for missingness will be summarised.
Patterns and predictors of missingness will also be investigated and summarised.
Descriptive and summary statistics will generally be based on complete-cases data.
The primary analyses will be based on complete-cases.
Secondary analyses using multiple imputation for missing responses and covariates will be undertaken to investigate sensitivity of the results.

\subsection*{Sensitivity Analyses}

Sensitivity of results to the specified priors will be investigated by estimating parameters under different prior configurations than those used in the primary analyses.
In particular, the hyperparameter for prior variances will be varied to assess how conclusions may change under varying strength of the prior.

\section*{Operating Characteristics}

The operating characteristics of the OPTIMUM trial were estimated using Monte Carlo methods specifying various scenarios for the data generating process. The final thresholds were selected informally on the basis of their type I error, type II error, and expected sample size.

\subsection*{Scenarios}

A first interim analysis is scheduled to occur when primary endpoint data is available on 200 subjects.
Subsequent interim analyses occur every additional 200 subjects with available endpoint data until fewer than 100 subjects remain to be enrolled, or enrolment is complete.

Trial data was generated allowing variations in: accrual rate and pattern of accrual, time to primary endpoint, true response probability in the control and treatment arms, and decision thresholds.

Accrual was assumed to follow a non-homogeneous Poisson process and we investigated varying the baseline rate and varying the shape of accrual by allowing for slow initial accrual and a ramp-up in the latter stages of the trial.
We assumed baseline accrual of 16 per week, and 5 per week (slow accrual is worst case for false positives), and ramp-up accrual.

Time to primary outcome was assumed to be uniform between 48 and 72 weeks (mean 60 weeks) post-randomisation.

The probability of food-allergy within the comparator vaccine, $\theta_a^\star$, and study vaccine, $\theta_w^\star$, populations investigated were $\theta_a^\star=0.1$ and $\theta_w^\star\in\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09,0.1\}$.
Data were generated as Bernoulli random variables using the specified probability with time of enrolment generated from the accrual specification, and time to response generated from the time to outcome specification.

A grid of decision threshold values was investigated across all scenarios.
For the final analysis, posterior probability thresholds of $q\in\{0.95,0.955,0.96,0.965,0.97\}$ were investigated.
Futility thresholds were fixed across all interim analyses and set to $\underline{c}_k\in\{0,0.025,0.05,0.075,0.1,0.2\}$.
Expected success thresholds were fixed across all interim analyses and set to $\overline{c}_k\in\{0.8,0.9,0.925,0.95,0.975,1\}$.

The scenarios explored are summarised in Table \ref{tab:scenarios}.
